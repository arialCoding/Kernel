This is a Personal project dedicated to learn OS developement. It started as a support for a PDF Document I created using LaTeX as part of ITE Fall 2024 Project. (Please Find that version in its dedicated branch).
in this main branch I will continue developing the kernel main modules, and eventually a shell.

To compile it you will need a cross-compiler and linker.

you can directly access the built version from the releases. use qemu-system-x86_64 -fda os-image.bin to run it.
